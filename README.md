This project is a GitHub automation tool written in Python, designed to help users automate common GitHub actions such as following, unfollowing, and starring repositories. This bot is **actively maintained**.

## Features

- üë• **Follow users** from a specific GitHub account or follow random trending users.
- ‚≠ê **Automatically star** repositories of followed users.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed:

1. **Python 3.x**: Check Python installation:

   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

#### If Python is not installed, download and install it from the official Python website.

2. **pip**: Python‚Äôs package manager to install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip --version
   ```

3. GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT):

- Visit GitHub Developer Settings and generate a new token.
- Grant "Contents" permissions for read/write access to public repositories.
- Copy the token to use in the `.env` file.

## Project Setup

#### Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rubsxyz/github-automation-bot.git
```

2. **Navigate into the project folder:**

```bash
cd github-automation-bot
```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment**

#### For Windows:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### For macOS/Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install Dependencies**

Install the required Python libraries using the requirements.txt file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project to store your GitHub API token and username. The file should look like this:

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_token_here"
GITHUB_USERNAME="your_github_username_here"
```

Make sure to replace `your_github_token_here` and `your_github_username_here` with your actual GitHub Personal Access Token and username.

5. **Run the Script**
   Run the main menu by executing the main.py script:

```bash
python main.py
```

6. **Choose an Option from the Menu**

Once the script is running, you'll see the following menu options:
